Static libraries vs dynamic libraries in embedded systems:

------

|      | static libraries            | dynamic libraries           |
| ---- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
|      | Compilation time linking    | Runtime linking             |
|      | Have deterministic behavior | Code re-usability           |
|      | Ease of deployment          | Flexibility and upgradeable |
